The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and iteratively developed the Marwyck Copilot application, a SaaS platform for US real estate agents. The initial phase focused on delivering a simulated MVP to quickly validate the user experience, rather than full API integrations. This involved building a functional UI for core features like chat commands, multi-channel follow-ups, document management, planning, and property estimation, all powered by simulated data and responses. Subsequent iterations were driven by detailed user feedback, primarily focusing on extensive UI/UX refinements, design consistency (e.g., universal rounded corners, dark mode adjustments, improved modal interactions), and minor bug fixes. The development workflow was characterized by rapid iteration, applying design system guidelines, and addressing specific visual and functional nuances requested by the user, leading to a highly polished and interactive prototype.

<product_requirements>
The Marwyck Copilot application aims to automate time-consuming tasks for US real estate agents through an AI-powered copilot centered on a chat interface. The core value proposition is to save 2-4 hours daily, reduce document omissions, decrease no-shows, and provide rapid property estimations.
The MVP features include:
1.  **Multi-channel Follow-ups**: Automated sequences (SMS, email, AI calls) with tracking and notifications.
2.  **Central Command Chat**: Single interface using -commands and natural language.
3.  **Document Management**: PDF upload, dynamic checklists, missing piece detection, automated reminders.
4.  **Intelligent Planning**: Calendar connection, optimized slot proposals, rescheduling, SMS reminders.
5.  **Property Estimation**: Price range and PDF report based on comparables.
6.  **Specialized Pages**: Dashboard, Chat, Planning, Documents, SMS & Calls (history).
7.  **360° Dashboard**: KPIs (time saved, file status, upcoming appointments).

The initial request specified a simulated MVP where all external integrations (OpenAI, Twilio, SendGrid, Google Calendar, Zillow/Redfin) were to be placeholders, displaying simulated outcomes (e.g., SMS programmé). Subsequent enhancements included a retractable sidebar, weekly dashboard navigation, chat client selection by dossier, planning navigation, detailed document management (add/edit/delete dossiers, contacts, documents), a dedicated estimation page, and extensive UI refinements like consistent rounded corners for all interactive elements and modals. The current focus is on perfecting the dark mode color scheme.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard Next.js 14 App Router structure.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the root layout for the entire application, including the HTML structure, global styles, and overall theme providers. It wraps the main application content.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup of the layout, including imports for fonts (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans, Space Grotesk) and . It incorporates the  for dark/light mode and potentially wraps the main content with the  and  components. It was modified to integrate the theme and layout structure.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main entry point for the frontend, serving as the primary client component where most of the application's UI and logic reside. It orchestrates the rendering of different sections (Dashboard, Chat, Planning, Documents, Estimation, Account) based on the current active page.
    -   **Changes**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. Initially, it built the core simulated MVP. Subsequent changes incorporated:
        -   Sidebar toggle logic and styling.
        -   Dashboard weekly navigation, KPI displays, and Préparation RDV suggestions.
        -   Chat interface enhancements (client selection from dossiers, Aide IA modal, send button alignment, attachment/voice transcription buttons).
        -   Planning modals for adding/proposing/re-scheduling appointments, and event detail modals.
        -   Document management with add/edit/delete dossier functionalities and contact/document status updates.
        -   Dedicated Estimation de biens page.
        -   Header updates (date, time, traffic indicator, removal of specific elements).
        -   Implementation of the custom color picker for the accent theme.
        -   Refinement of all modals and input fields for consistent rounded corners and proper background/opacity handling.
        -   Correction of missing  icon import.
        -   Improvements to ensure data persistence within the simulated environment for planning events and dossier modifications.
        -   Ongoing adjustments to the dark mode color scheme.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains global CSS styles and Tailwind CSS directives.
    -   **Changes**: Setup of base Tailwind CSS, font imports, and potentially custom utility classes or  definitions as per the design guide. It was modified to ensure custom font imports and overall base styling.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the Next.js backend API routes. Although the current MVP relies heavily on client-side simulation, this file is the designated place for future backend API implementations (e.g., connecting to MongoDB, Twilio, SendGrid etc.).
    -   **Changes**: The trajectory does not detail specific functional changes or snippets for this file, implying its role has primarily been as a placeholder or for basic setup. The current data management is client-side.

<pending_tasks>
-   Refine the dark theme color palette to ensure it uses true gray tones instead of bluish hues.
-   Implement the dedicated Compte (Account) page with user profile, preferences, and statistics, accessible via the button in the sidebar.

<current_work>
The application, Marwyck Copilot, is currently in a highly functional simulated MVP state. The UI is extensively refined, adhering closely to the Marwyck design guide with a professional and modern aesthetic. All primary features specified in the initial requirements are visually and functionally implemented with intelligent simulations, including:

-   **Chat Interface**: Features a ChatGPT-like design, dynamic client selection based on dossier addresses (Général option), a rounded Aide IA modal explaining AI capabilities, and properly aligned chat input/send elements. It includes simulated attachment and voice transcription buttons.
-   **Dashboard**: Displays KPIs, navigable weekly views with restricted future navigation, and a new Préparation RDV section offering smart suggestions.
-   **Planning System**: Provides interactive weekly calendar view. Modals for Nouveau RDV, Proposer créneaux, and Replanifier are functional with simulated logic and persistence. Clicking an event shows a detailed modal with quick actions.
-   **Document Management**: Allows adding new dossiers (Vente, Achat, Location) with dynamic checklists, and includes edit/delete functionalities for dossiers and their contacts/documents. Modifications persist within the simulation.
-   **Property Estimation**: A dedicated page with rounded input fields for property details and simulated price estimates.
-   **Global UI/UX**: Features a retractable sidebar with a custom color picker (Couleurs section) for the accent theme, an optimized dark/light mode toggle. The header displays the current date (formatted with uppercase first letter for the day) and a simulated traffic indicator. All interactive elements, buttons, and modals throughout the application consistently have rounded corners (rounded-xl for cards, rounded-2xl for modals).

The immediate preceding work involved resolving various UI inconsistencies, particularly related to modal styling (rounded borders, correct backgrounds) and ensuring data updates (planning events, dossier modifications) were reflected in the simulated environment. The last confirmed fix was ensuring dynamic client names in the chat from dossier addresses and functional modals/data updates across planning and document management. The dark mode color scheme was adjusted, but the user still perceives it as not sufficiently gray.
